1) When creating new users, there is an extra array that is added to the csv file and the carriage return/new line is not correct. This just makes it jumbled and messy
2) I need to create a count variable of some sort to keep track of how many rows there are in the csv file so the user can choose correctly
3) The questions still need to be added into the csv file prompt

Additional but not necessary:
-Check to make sure that the answers to the questions are within the scale of 1-10
